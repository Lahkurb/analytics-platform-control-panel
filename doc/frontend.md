# Frontend app

The Control Panel Frontend is a OIDC login protected web application which
allows users of the Analytical Platform to manage their hosted tools (including
RStudio and Jupyter Lab), web apps and data sources. It also provides an admin
interface for superusers to manage other users.

## Contributing

### Design System

The Frontend app makes use of the [GOV.UK Frontend Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/get-started/production/) and the [Ministry of Justice Design System](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/moj-design-system)  to markup and style the web interface.

We install the design systems using npm, to easily track updated releases. The npm
packages are automatically installed as part of the Docker image build.

We use the SASS styles and Javascript sources directly, but because the Nunjucks
templates are not entirely compatible with Jinja2, we cannot use them (although
we can derive Jinja2 templates from them fairly trivially).

## Unit testing

The jest unit test framework is set up on this project and can be used to test
the frontend components.

### Writing

See [selectable-rows.test.js](../controlpanel/frontend/static/components/selectable-rows/selectable-rows.test.js) for an example

- Create a file in `<rootDir>/controlpanel/frontend/components/<componentName>/`
  called `component.test.js`. The important part is that it ends with `.test.js`.
- In the new file:
    - `require('component.js')`.
    - create a suite with a `describe('thing', () => {})` block.
    - set up your minimal html document in a `beforeEach(() => {})` block.


#### Matchers you can use

### Running

To run the suite once:
    `npm run test`

To run with coverage:
    `npm run test -- --coverage`

To keep running as you make changes
    `npm run test -- --watch`
